## Vue.js2-2-Cookbook
The book is published by Packt Publishing Ltd in 2017 and is written by Andrea Passaglia. This book has been tested on people who didnâ€™t even know JavaScript. They were able to pick up Vue by reading the first chapter! Going forward, you will find concepts that are more and more advanced and, even if you are familiar with Vue 2, you will probably find some trick you didn't know about or some wise suggestion that will help you along the way.
This book, if followed from cover to cover, will turn you into a proficient Vue developer. On the other hand, if you already are, it provides a good reference for many different features and techniques that may come in handy from time to time. Finally, this book is also a valid migration guide if you have already experimented with Vue 1 and you feel overwhelmed by change.
All subjects which the chapters of this book covers:
- **Chapter 1** Getting Started, is where you create your first Vue application and get familiar with the most
common features and development tools.
- **Chapter 2**, Basic Vue.js Features, is where you effortlessly build lists and forms, and learn how to style
them.
- **Chapter 3**, Transitions and Animations, where you learn how transitions and animations work to bring more
life to your apps. You will also integrate with external CSS libraries.
- **Chapter 4**, Components!, is where you realize everything in Vue is a component and you can exploit this to
reduce duplication and reuse your code.
- **Chapter 5**, Communicate with the Internet, is where you make your first AJAX call and create forms and a
full fledged REST client (and server!).
- **Chapter 6**, Single Page Applications, is where you use vue-router to create static and dynamic routes to
create a modern SPA.
- **Chapter 7**, Unit Testing and End-To-End Testing, is where you learn to create professional software by
adding Karma, Chai, Moka, Sinon.JS, and nightwatch to make sure you can refactor your app with
confidence.
- **Chapter 8**, Organize + Automate + Deploy = Webpack, is where you actually publish your accurately
crafted components to npm and learn how Webpack and Vue play together in the process.
- **Chapter 9**, Advanced Vue.js, is where you explore directives, plugins, functional components, and JSX.
- **Chapter 10**, Large Application Patterns with Vuex, is where you structure your application with tested
patterns using Vuex to make sure your apps are maintainable and performant.
- **Chapter 11**, Integrating with External Frameworks, is where you build four different applications with Vue
and Electron, Firebase, Feathers, and Horizon.
